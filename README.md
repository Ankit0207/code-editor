# Code Editor

## Overview üîî

This project is a simple code editor built in React. It utilizes Prism JS for syntax highlighting and is implemented using various technologies such as React, HTML, CS and JavaScript.


## Implementation

A simple code editor is essentially a `textarea` element with syntax highlighting. Since the default HTML `textarea` doesn‚Äôt support syntax highlighting, we use a library like Prism JS to achieve this functionality. By combining Prism JS with React, we create a code editor where the user's input is automatically syntax-highlighted.


## Technologies Used

- **Prism JS**: A library for syntax highlighting.
  - [Prism JS Website](https://prismjs.com/): A vanilla JavaScript library for syntax highlighting.
  - [Prism React Renderer](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer): A React implementation of Prism JS.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **HTML**: HyperText Markup Language for structuring web pages.
- **CSS**: Cascading Style Sheets for styling web pages.


### Features

- Syntax highlighting for code input.
- Different editor for different language.
- Proper indentation and formatting.
- Clean and intuitive user interface.
- Support for typing and editing code in real-time.
